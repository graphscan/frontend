# Graphscan
Welcome to Graphscan - the open-source analytic service based on The Graph protocol. Graphscan provides detailed statistics and analytics for The Graph protocol, including statistics for Indexers, Delegators, and Curators. In addition, Graphscan features comprehensive statistics on Subgraphs within The Graph protocol across different networks.

# Overview
The Graph protocol is a decentralized indexing and querying protocol for blockchain data. Graphscan offers unparalleled insight and analysis into its inner workings. By leveraging subgraphs within The Graph protocol, Graphscan enables you to:

- Compare the efficiency of Indexers
- Examine Indexers' strategies for working with allocations
- Learn from other network participants' strategies

Curators and Delegators can also use Graphscan to determine their profitability.

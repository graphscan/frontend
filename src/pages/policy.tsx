                legal obligations that may limit this right, the data subjects
                can request their data elimination when: the data no longer
                needs to be processed for the purpose that justified its
                collection or processing; the data subject withdraws its consent
                on which the data processing was grounded and there are no other
                legal grounds for it; they present opposition to the processing
                of the data and there are no prevailing legal interests, to be
                assessed on a case by case basis, that justify the processing;
                when the data has been processed illegally; the personal data

                its accuracy; if the processing is illegal and the data subject
                opposes to their personal data being deleted and requests that
                its use be limited; if the data processor no longer needs the
                data to be processed but the data is still necessary for the

                legal process; if the user opposes to the processing, until it
                is seen that the legitimate interests of the data processor

                <strong>The right of objection</strong>: the data subject has

                    tablet) and that are used whenever users return to the
                    Website. They are normally used to direct the browser
                    according to the users´ interests, allowing the Website to
                    provide a more personal service.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Session cookies</strong> - these are temporary
                    cookies that remain in the users' browser cookie folder
                    until they leave the website. The information these cookies
                    collect is used to analyze web traffic patterns, enabling
                    the Website to identify problems and provide a better
                    browser experience.
                  </li>

              </li>
              <li>
                The cookies are used, namely, for the following purposes:

                  <li>
                    <strong>Strictly necessary cookies</strong> - allow the
                    users to browse the website and use the applications as well
                    as letting users access secure areas on the website. Without
                    these cookies, the services the users request cannot be

                  <li>
                    <strong>Analytical cookies</strong> - these are cookies that
                    collect information about the use of the website, allowing
                    to improve the way it works. By way of example, cookies of
                    this nature are likely to reveal which pages are most
                    visited on the website and help to register any difficulties
                    that users experience when navigating and interacting on the
                    website, also having the virtuality to demonstrate whether
                    or not the advertising is effective. This makes it possible
                    to view and analyze overall patterns of website use, rather
                    than the use of a single individual.

                    campaigns taking into account the user's preferences and
                    they also limit the number of times an advert is seen,

                    usage intervals, and other analytics based on user activity

                    analytics providers (e.g. Cloudflare and Google Analytics)
                    may supplement the aggregated data with demographic data and
